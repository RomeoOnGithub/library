## provided instruction (summarised)
> You’re not required to add any type of storage right now to save the information between page reloads. You will have the option to come back to this project later on in the course.

1. Create a Book Constructor & Storage
- Store books in an array (myLibrary).
- Create a Book constructor.
- Write a function to add new books to myLibrary.

2. Display Books on the Page
- Write a function to loop through myLibrary and display each book in a table or card format.

3. Keep Data and Display Separate
- Maintain a clear distinction between data (book objects in the array) and UI (displaying books on the page).

4. Add a "New Book" Form
- Create a button that opens a form for adding books.
- Use event.preventDefault() to prevent form submission from reloading the page.

5. Implement Book Removal
- Add a button on each book’s display to remove it from myLibrary.
- Use data attributes to associate DOM elements with book objects.

6. Toggle Read Status
- Add a button on each book’s display to toggle its read status.
- Implement a Book prototype function to change the read status.
